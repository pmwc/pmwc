# PMWCS - Preact Material Web Components

This project is a fork of [RMWC][] replacing React with [preact][]. A round of applause üëè and thanks to these üëì awesome projects.

I'm aware that preact/compat together with webpack alias would allow to use [RMWC][]. Nonetheless to simplify usage with preact the decision was made to fork RMWC.

PMWCS is a Preact UI Kit built on Google's official [Material Components Web][] library v7.x.x

Features:

* [x] Uses Google's official material-components-web library
* [x] Includes Addon components for ones missing from the official spec
* [x] Works in preact 10
* [x] Individually packaged and released components
