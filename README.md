# PMWC - Preact Material Web Components

This project is a fork of [PMWC](https://pmwc.io) replacing React with [preact](https://preactjs.com). üëè Thanks to these üëì awesome projects.

I'm aware that preact/compat together with webpack alias would allow to use RMWC. Nonetheless to simplify usage with preact the decision was made to fork RMWC.

PMWC is a React UI Kit built on Google's official Material Components Web library v5.x.x

* [x] Includes Addon components for ones missing from the official spec
* [x] Works in preact 10
